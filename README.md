This research implements machine learning models to predict greyhound racing results of 380 metre races at Crayford in the United Kingdom. The question is formulated as a classification problem, with models designed to predict competitor finish position from first to sixth. Model prediction rates are benchmarked against the prediction rates of market opinion as calculated from the betting odds. The shortest odds being classified as a market prediction of first place and so on until all six runners are given a market classification. Two machine learning model types were used, a multinomial logistic regression and a gradient boosting classifier. A novel machine learning dataset was constructed from two online sources. Individual race results came from a Betfair API, Betfair being the world’s largest online betting website. Past performance data was then retrieved for each greyhound from the Racing Post’s Greyhound Portal. The final machine learning dataset contained 2,307 races, with 27 potential prediction variables or features and one target, finish position. 12 features were used in the multinomial logistic regression model with 23 used in the gradient boosting classifier.
